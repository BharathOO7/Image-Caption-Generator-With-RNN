Introduction

The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning-based system that generates meaningful and coherent captions for images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language modeling, the model learns to associate visual patterns with textual descriptions, bridging the gap between visual and linguistic understanding.
